think about stream reach problem:
	need to pair chemistry with macroinverts
	samples taken out of time, but we're thinking within a season is good enough
		assuming samples are really only collected for a few months, maybe april to july
	spatial matchups will be a different beast:
		stream distance will be one metric (we already have the points snapped)
		other thing will be interfering tributaries.
		finally, canadian streamlines have different scale and reach definition?
		approach:
			see how many samples we lose by requiring samples to coincide on the same reach
			if too many, start including things like nearby reaches, allowing 1 or more tribs, etc

access to all the points in both countries? pretty sure this was on a gdrive bridget sent. if not, lauren probs has it

volume change from DEMs?
	mine footprints probably haven't changed much, but they have gotten deeper
	can we determine this from DEMS?
	any thinking I can do about that to help?
		really just need the highest res DEMs possible
