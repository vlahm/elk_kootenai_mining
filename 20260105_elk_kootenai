GLC_FCS30D global 30-meter landcover change dataset
delineate 288 watersheds and send.
delineate all chemistry points too
	(not including cond)
	(or just the ones with 10yrs)
then we can look at landcover change and chemical change
	144 chem statoins

watersheds where there has been landcover change
also closest in time

find points with longest timeseries
find span with greatest spatial coverage
matchups

	High Resolution Digital Elevation Model (HRDEM) - CanElevation Series
	
1. locate mines (or crawl for them one-by one and proceed through these steps)
2. filter to those upstream of marginalized communities
3. (first pass: filter to those with an official company/government imapct report)
4. determine actual impact from public data. any contradictions/anomalies (like the fabricated invert data in west virginia)
5. publish
6. testify in court if necessary
